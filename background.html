			invention came a bunch of websites were invented. Yahoo was the first among these websites. It was launched in 1995 by Jerry Yang. Then Google
			followed in 1998. Amazon - the largest internet based sales site was founded by Jeff Bezos. In the 2000's websites like Youtube and social

	                The idea of Internet was first proposed by J.C.R. Licklider. Licklider was a porfessor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He later
			joined the DARPA-Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency- in 1962. The basis for internet connections was made when Leonard Kleinrock
			invented packet switching. Packet switching is the new switching method. The original method is called circuit switching. Packet switching
			divides the network communication into separate packets and are sent to their destination location which are reassembled together. Each packet
			is about one Kilobyte length.
